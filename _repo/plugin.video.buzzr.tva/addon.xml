        <description>Please visit [COLOR blue]https://www.tvaddons.co[/COLOR] for addon support! Buzzr is a pop culture time capsule – an unending celebration where viewers can play along to some of Fremantle's vast portfolio of more than 40,000 iconic game show episodes, which are shown around the clock. Featured titles include Family Feud, where you won’t want to miss the outrageously fun Richard Dawson kissing every female contestant; What’s My Line, featuring cultural icons becoming time-stamped contestants/panelists like a 29-year-old whip-smart Betty White and a young Muhammad Ali; as well as famed titles To Tell the Truth, Match Game, Password, Beat the Clock, Blockbusters and Card Sharks.</description>
